# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

In this react program I made
1. A well-organized react application with clear component structure
2. The user interface displays the following components:
 a. Instagram Logo
 b. A button to switch between sign up and login views
 c. Basic input fields for username and password
 d. If the user chooses to sign up, additional input fields for name, email, etc., is displayed
